# blood-group-detector-by-image-processing
This project leverages the YOLOv8 object detection model to identify and classify human blood groups (A, B, AB, O) from blood sample images. The model is trained on labeled datasets and optimized for real-time and accurate detection, potentially useful in healthcare, emergencies, and diagnostic applications.
